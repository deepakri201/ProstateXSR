# ProstateXSR

This repository provides the code used to create DICOM SRs for the ProstateX collection. We obtain the lesion information from csv files located [here](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/prostatex/). For ease of use, they have been uploaded as a GitHub attachement to this repository.
