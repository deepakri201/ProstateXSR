# ProstateXSR

This repository provides the code used to create DICOM SRs for the ProstateX collection. We obtain the lesion information from csv files located [here](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/prostatex/). We use the results from the 2nd challenge, with training lesion information [here](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/wp-content/uploads/ProstateX2-DataInfo-Train.zip) and testing lesion information [here](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/wp-content/uploads/ProstateX2-DataInfo-Test.zip).
